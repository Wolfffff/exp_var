              systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription
              factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification.
              These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of
              the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied
              protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory
              elements are physically associated with one another and with
              expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of
              gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a
              statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human
              disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation.
              Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization

              modification has not been assayed in more than a few individuals

              heterogeneity are not well understood. We investigated the loss

              showed strong age dependence, with B cell levels in particular

              simultaneously profile the gene expression of four immune cell
              subpopulations (CD4T, CD8T, B cells, and monocytes) in 39 World
              Trade Center responders (20 with and 19 without PTSD) to
              determine which immune subsets play a role in the transcriptomic
              changes found in whole blood. Transcriptome-wide analyses
              identified cell-specific and shared differentially expressed

              Differentially expressed genes were used in pathway analysis and
              to create a polygenic expression score. There were 448
              differentially expressed genes in the discovery cohort, of which
              99 remained significant in the replication cohort, including
              FKBP5, which was found to be up-regulated in current PTSD

              outcomes both at LCD termination and 6 mo after the LCD.Design:
              Using RNA sequencing (RNAseq), we analyzed transcriptome changes
              in AT from 191 obese, nondiabetic patients within a multicenter,
              controlled dietary intervention. Expression changes were
              associated with outcomes after an 8-wk LCD (800-1000 kcal/d) and

              classify weight maintainers or glycemic improvers.Results: With
              RNAseq analyses, we identified 1173 genes that were
              differentially expressed after the LCD, of which 350 and 33 were
              associated with changes in body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) and
              Matsuda index values, respectively, whereas 29 genes were
              associated with both endpoints. Pathway analyses highlighted
              enrichment in lipid and glucose metabolism. Classification models
              were constructed to identify weight maintainers. A model based on
              clinical baseline variables could not achieve any classification

              performed to classify subjects with good glycemic improvements.
              Baseline- and LCD-based clinical models yielded similar
              performance (best AUC: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.60, 0.86). The addition

              Challenges 6-74 longitudinal HIV-negative African cohort of

              Overall, 79 progressors who developed TB between 3 and 24 months
              after diagnosis of index case and 328 matched nonprogressors who
              remained healthy during 24 months of follow-up were

              signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian
              training set predicted progression up to two years before onset
              of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the
              Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated
              variability, and it was also validated in an external cohort of
              South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection.
              By contrast, published diagnostic or prognostic TB signatures

              Application of a validated transcriptional correlate of risk for

              associated with HCC, but a comprehensive analysis of their
              specific association with HCC metastasis has not been conducted.
              Here, by analysing 60 clinical samples' RNA-seq data from 20 HCC
              patients, we have identified and characterized 8,603 candidate
              lncRNAs. The expression patterns of 917 recurrently deregulated
              lncRNAs are correlated with clinical data in a TCGA cohort and
              published liver cancer data. Matched array data from the 60
              samples show that copy number variations (CNVs) and alterations
              in DNA methylation contribute to the observed recurrent
              deregulation of 235 lncRNAs. Many recurrently deregulated lncRNAs
              are enriched in co-expressed clusters of genes related to cell
              adhesion, immune response and metabolic processes. Candidate
              lncRNAs related to metastasis, such as HAND2-AS1, were further
              validated using RNAi-based loss-of-function assays. Thus, we
              provide a valuable resource of functional lncRNAs and biomarkers

              Previous transcriptomic studies investigating the mechanisms of
              PTSD apply targeted approaches to identify individual genes under
              a cross-sectional framework lack a holistic view of the
              behaviours and properties of these genes at the system-level.
              Here we sought to apply an unsupervised gene-network based
              approach to a prospective experimental design using
              whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq gene expression from peripheral blood
              leukocytes of U.S. Marines (N=188), obtained both pre- and
              post-deployment to conflict zones. We identified discrete groups
              of co-regulated genes (i.e., co-expression modules) and tested
              them for association to PTSD. We identified one module at both
              pre- and post-deployment containing putative causal signatures
              for PTSD development displaying an over-expression of genes
              enriched for functions of innate-immune response and interferon
              signalling (Type-I and Type-II). Importantly, these results were
              replicated in a second non-overlapping independent dataset of
              U.S. Marines (N=96), further outlining the role of innate immune
              and interferon signalling genes within co-expression modules to
              explain at least part of the causal pathophysiology for PTSD
              development. A second module, consequential of trauma exposure,
              contained PTSD resiliency signatures and an over-expression of
              genes involved in hemostasis and wound responsiveness suggesting
              that chronic levels of stress impair proper wound healing
              during/after exposure to the battlefield while highlighting the
              role of the hemostatic system as a clinical indicator of
              chronic-based stress. These findings provide novel insights for
              early preventative measures and advanced PTSD detection, which

              few months after exposure. We reasoned that this risk reflects
              incipient disease among tuberculosis contacts. Blood
              transcriptional biomarkers of tuberculosis may predate clinical
              diagnosis, suggesting they offer improved sensitivity to detect
              subclinical incipient disease. Therefore, we sought to test the
              hypothesis that refined blood transcriptional biomarkers of
              active tuberculosis will improve stratification of short-term
              disease risk in tuberculosis contacts. METHODS: We combined
              analysis of previously published blood transcriptomic data with
              new data from a prospective human immunodeficiency virus
              (HIV)-negative UK cohort of 333 tuberculosis contacts. We used
              stability selection as an alternative computational approach to
              identify an optimal signature for short-term risk of active
              tuberculosis and evaluated its predictive value in independent
              cohorts. RESULTS: In a previously published HIV-negative South
              African case-control study of patients with asymptomatic
              Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, a novel 3-gene
              transcriptional signature comprising BATF2, GBP5, and SCARF1
              achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 23\% for
              progression to active tuberculosis within 90 days. In a new UK
              cohort of 333 HIV-negative tuberculosis contacts with a median
              follow-up of 346 days, this signature achieved a PPV of 50\%
              (95\% confidence interval [CI], 15.7-84.3) and negative
              predictive value of 99.3\% (95\% CI, 97.5-99.9). By comparison,
              peripheral blood interferon gamma release assays in the same
              cohort achieved a PPV of 5.6\% (95\% CI, 2.1-11.8). CONCLUSIONS:

              and independent of clinical inflammation. An abnormal increase of
              antimicrobial dual oxidase (DUOX2) expression was detected in
              association with an expansion of Proteobacteria in both UC and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Identification of imprinted genes, demonstrating a
              consistent preference towards the paternal or maternal allelic
              expression, is important for the understanding of gene expression
              regulation during embryonic development and of the molecular
              basis of developmental disorders with a parent-of-origin effect.
              Combining allelic analysis of RNA-Seq data with phased genotypes
              in family trios provides a powerful method to detect
              parent-of-origin biases in gene expression. RESULTS: We report
              findings in 296 family trios from two large studies: 165
              lymphoblastoid cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project and 131
              blood samples from the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL)
              participants. Based on parental haplotypes, we identified > 2.8
              million transcribed heterozygous SNVs phased for parental origin
              and developed a robust statistical framework for measuring
              allelic expression. We identified a total of 45 imprinted genes
              and one imprinted unannotated transcript, including multiple
              imprinted transcripts showing incomplete parental expression bias
              that was located adjacent to strongly imprinted genes. For
              example, PXDC1, a gene which lies adjacent to the paternally
              expressed gene FAM50B, shows a 2:1 paternal expression bias.
              Other imprinted genes had promoter regions that coincide with
              sites of parentally biased DNA methylation identified in the
              blood from uniparental disomy (UPD) samples, thus providing
              independent validation of our results. Using the stranded nature
              of the RNA-Seq data in lymphoblastoid cell lines, we identified
              multiple loci with overlapping sense/antisense transcripts, of
              which one is expressed paternally and the other maternally. Using
              a sliding window approach, we searched for imprinted expression
              across the entire genome, identifying a novel imprinted putative
              lncRNA in 13q21.2. Overall, we identified 7 transcripts showing
              parental bias in gene expression which were not reported in 4
              other recent RNA-Seq studies of imprinting. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              methods and data provide a robust and high-resolution map of
