A network of transcriptome modules demonstrates mechanistic pathways of both virus induced and non-viral asthma exacerbations in children [blood],SRP150552,,longitudinal,"We leverage a systems-scale network analysis approach to demonstrate repertoires of cellular transcriptional pathways underlying loss of asthma control, and show how these pathways differ in viral associated and non-viral exacerbations. Overall design: 208 children with exacerbation prone asthma were enrolled according to the inclusion criteria. Each child had baseline samples collected and were prospectively monitored for the onset of cold symptoms (Events) during a 6 month period. 106/208 children came in during one or more events and had sufficient samples collected for analysis. Events were grouped as exacerbation associated (Ex+) or not exacerbation associated (Ex-) depending on whether the event lead to clinical symptoms that resulted in systemic corticosteroid use within 10 days of event onset or resolved without treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The primary endpoint compared Ex+ events to Ex- events. Based on nasal virus PCR results, events were further classified as virus associated (V+) or nonviral (V-). The secondary endpoint compared V+Ex+, V+Ex-, V-Ex+, and V-Ex- events.",Baseline should be fine. Timepoint!
Cell type-specific immune phenotypes predict loss of insulin secretion in new-onset type 1 diabetes,SRP174638,,longitudinal,"Peripheral blood samples were collected from control-arm subjects enrolled in 6 clinical trials conducted by the Immune Tolerance Network and Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet. The included trials evaluated immune-modifying therapy in new-onset T1D, with similar trial timecourses, primary outcomes, and data and sample collection. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood samples and then globin-reduced. RNAseq libraries were prepared from the globin-reduced RNA. Overall design: Subjects from the control arms of 6 clinical trials in new-onset T1D were aggregated to evaluate variation in disease course in the immediate post-diagnostic period. All trials used serum C-peptide concentration after a mixed-meal tolerance test as the primary outcome, with an initial trial duration of approximately two years, with longer-term follow-up in some cases. We obtained RNA-seq data from all available subject visits (N = 138 subjects), ranging from the time of study entry to three years, for a total of 496 samples (mean 3.6 samples per subject). Three samples were removed due to SNP-based kinship values indicating sample contamination or mis-identification; these samples are excluded from the submitted dataset. Of the remaining 493 samples, 471 yielded high-quality RNA-seq data from unique visits consistent with subject annotation, and were used in downstream analyses.",Multiple time points per subject
Discovering in vivo cytokine eQTL interactions from a lupus clinical trial,SRP150872,,longitudinal,"Background: Cytokines are critical to human disease and are attractive therapeutic targets given their widespread influence on gene regulation and transcription. Defining the downstream regulatory mechanisms influenced by cytokines is central to defining drug and disease mechanisms. One promising strategy is to use interactions between expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cytokine levels to define target genes and mechanisms. Results: In a clinical trial for anti-IL-6 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus we measured interferon (IFN) status, anti-IL-6 drug exposure and whole blood genome-wide gene expression at three time points (379 samples from 157 individuals). First, we show that repeat transcriptomic measurements increases the number of cis eQTLs identified compared to using a single time point by 64%. Then, after identifying 4,818 cis-eQTLs, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of in vivo eQTL interactions with IFN status (p<0.001 by permutation) and anti-IL-6 drug exposure (p<0.001). We observed 210 and 72 interactions for IFN and anti-IL-6 respectively (FDR<20%). Anti-IL-6 interactions have not yet been described while 99 of the IFN interactions are novel. Finally, we found transcription factor binding motifs interrupted by eQTL interaction SNPs, pointing to key regulatory mediators of these environmental stimuli and therefore potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. In particular, genes with IFN interactions are enriched for ISRE binding site motifs, while those with anti-IL-6 interactions are enriched for IRF4 motifs. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential to exploit clinical trial data to discover in vivo eQTL interactions with therapeutically relevant environmental variables. Overall design: Whole blood RNA-seq of 379 samples (across 3 time points) from 157 individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus",
A blood RNA signature for tuberculosis disease risk in household contact study - GC6 cohort.,SRP098758,,longitudinal,"Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease might lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic in the context of house hold contacts. Overall design: Samples are collected from subjects in a household contact study after a person comes back to the household, diagnosed with TB. Samples are collected every 6 months upto, 18 months. Some people go on to develop TB (cases) where as some others do not (controls). Here we are trying to establish a gene signature to predict the occurance of TB.",
"Transcriptome profiling from adipose tissue during low-caloric diet reveals predictors of long-term weight and glycemic outcomes in obese, non-diabetic subjects",SRP101294,,control,"Background: Low-caloric diet (LCD) reduces fat mass excess, improves insulin sensitivity, and alters adipose tissue (AT) gene expression. Yet the relationship with long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. Objective: We evaluated transcriptome alterations in AT during LCD and association with weight and glycemic outcomes both at LCD termination and 6-month after the LCD. Results: Upon LCD, we identified 1'173 genes differentially expressed; with 350 and 33 genes associated respectively with changes in BMI and Matsuda. Twenty-nine genes were associated with both endpoints. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment in lipid and glucose metabolism. Models were constructed to predict weight maintainers. A model based on clinical baseline parameters could not achieve any prediction (validation's AUC= 0.50 [0.36, 0.64]), while a model based on clinical changes during LCD yielded to good performance (AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.87]). Incorporating baseline expression from the 18 genes outperformed the best clinical model (AUC=0.87 [0.77, 0.96], Delong's p=0.012). Similar analyses were made to predict subjects with good glycemic improvements. Both baseline- and LCD-based clinical models yielded to similar performance (with best AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.85]). Addition of expression changes during LCD improved substantially the performance (AUC=0.80 [0.69, 0.92], p=0.058). Conclusions: This study investigated AT transcriptome alterations following LCD in a large cohort of obese, non-diabetic patients. The identified genes enabled to significantly improve clinical models and predict long-term clinical outcomes. These biomarkers may help clinicians understanding the large inter-subject variability and better predict the success of dietary interventions. Overall design: Design: Using RNAseq, we analyzed transcriptome changes in AT from 191 obese, non-diabetic patients within a multi-center controlled dietary intervention. Expression changes were associated with outcomes after 8-week LCD (with 800-1000kcal/d) and 6-month after LCD. Results were validated using RT-qPCR in 350 subjects from the same cohort. Statistical models were constructed to predict subjects considered as weight maintainers or glycemic improvers 6-month after LCD.",Diet change

Analysis of parent-of-origin bias in gene expression levels,SRP095272,,control,"In order to study parent-of-origin effects on gene expression, we performed RNAseq analysis (100bp single end reads) of 165 children who formed part of mother/father/child trios where genotype data was available from the HapMap and/or 1000 Genomes Projects. Based on phased genotypes at heterozygous SNP positions, we generated allelic counts for expression of the maternal and paternal alleles in each individual. This analysis reveals significant bias in the expression of the parental alleles for dozens of genes, including both previously known and novel imprinted transcripts. Overall design: This submission contains RNAseq data from 165 children from mother/father/child trios studied as part of the 1000 genomes and/or HapMap projects. We provide raw fastq format reads, and processed read counts per gene. Allelic count information can be provided by directly contacting the authors.",They use 1000 genomes/hapmap individuals
Gene expression associated with PTSD in World Trade Center responders: An RNA sequencing study,SRP102999,,case-cotrol,"The gene expression approach has provided promising insights into the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, few studies used hypothesis-free transcriptome-wide expression approach. Transcriptome-wide expression study using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of whole blood was conducted in 324 World Trade Center responders (201 with never, 81 current and 42 past PTSD). The current and never PTSD samples were randomly split to form both discovery (N=195) and replication (N=87) cohorts. Differentially expressed genes identified in RNA-Seq were used in pathway analysis and to create a polygenic expression score. There were 448 differentially expressed genes in the discovery cohort, of which 99 remained significant in the replication cohort, and 5 (FKBP5, NDUFA1, CCDC85B, SNORD54, SNORD46) showed >1.2-fold difference in expression consistently between the discovery and replication cohorts. Several enriched biological pathways were found, including glucocorticoid receptor signaling and immunity-related pathways, but were not significant following FDR correction. The gene expression score achieved sensitivity of 0.917 and specificity of 0.508 for identifying PTSD cases in the replication cohort. It was similar in current and past PTSD, with both groups scoring higher than trauma-exposed controls. We confirmed the role of FKBP5 in PTSD and identified four additional differentially expressed genes that may constitute biomarkers for this condition. Together with the pathway analysis results, these findings point to HPA-axis and immune dysregulation as key biological processes underpinning PTSD. A novel polygenic expression aggregate that differentiates PTSD patients from trauma-exposed controls might be a useful screening tool for research and clinical practice, if replicated in other populations. Overall design: 324 human samples; 201 never, 82 current, 41 past with PTSD. Gene expression profiling by high throughput sequencing",

Age-of-Onset Dependent Immune maturation in Pediatric Crohn Disease,SRP113470,,case-control,"Purpose: To clarify the biological processes underlying variation in disease location and antimicrobial sero-reactivity across age-of onset in pediatric Crohn disease. Methods: We characterize the ileal global pattern of gene expression using single-end, 50bp RNA-sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 in 304 treatment-naïve pediatric Crohn patients and non-IBD controls. Reads were quantified using Kallisto with Gencodev23 annotations. For all analyses, data were stratified by patient age-of-onset. Results: Performing differential analysis of all reasonably-expressed transcripts (TPM>5 in =5 samples, with significance defined as FDR-corrected p-value<0.05 and fold change=1.5), we identify a robust gene signature with higher expresison of an immune gene set in older patients (=10 years at diagnosis) compared to younger patients (<10 years at diagnosis), and a decrease in expression of antimicrobial Paneth cell-derived a-defensins. Conclusion: We provide evidence for maturation of mucosal Th1 immune response and loss of epithelial antimicrobial a-defensins with increasing age-of-onset. Overall design: Ileal gene expression profiles were generated for 304 treatment-naïve pediatric Crohn patients and non-IBD controls.",More Crohn's
"RNA-seq of tumor-educated platelets enables blood-based pan-cancer, multiclass and molecular pathway cancer diagnostics",SRP057500,,multi-group,"	We report RNA-sequencing data of 283 blood platelet samples, including 228 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with six different malignant tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer and hepatobiliary carcinomas). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 55 healthy individuals. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based ''liquid biopsies'' in patients with several types with cancer, including the ability for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer and companion diagnostics. Overall design: Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit.
