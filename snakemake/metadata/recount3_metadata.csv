A network of transcriptome modules demonstrates mechanistic pathways of both virus induced and non-viral asthma exacerbations in children [blood],SRP150552,,longitudinal,"We leverage a systems-scale network analysis approach to demonstrate repertoires of cellular transcriptional pathways underlying loss of asthma control, and show how these pathways differ in viral associated and non-viral exacerbations. Overall design: 208 children with exacerbation prone asthma were enrolled according to the inclusion criteria. Each child had baseline samples collected and were prospectively monitored for the onset of cold symptoms (Events) during a 6 month period. 106/208 children came in during one or more events and had sufficient samples collected for analysis. Events were grouped as exacerbation associated (Ex+) or not exacerbation associated (Ex-) depending on whether the event lead to clinical symptoms that resulted in systemic corticosteroid use within 10 days of event onset or resolved without treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The primary endpoint compared Ex+ events to Ex- events. Based on nasal virus PCR results, events were further classified as virus associated (V+) or nonviral (V-). The secondary endpoint compared V+Ex+, V+Ex-, V-Ex+, and V-Ex- events.",Baseline should be fine. Timepoint!
Cell type-specific immune phenotypes predict loss of insulin secretion in new-onset type 1 diabetes,SRP174638,,longitudinal,"Peripheral blood samples were collected from control-arm subjects enrolled in 6 clinical trials conducted by the Immune Tolerance Network and Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet. The included trials evaluated immune-modifying therapy in new-onset T1D, with similar trial timecourses, primary outcomes, and data and sample collection. Total RNA was isolated from whole blood samples and then globin-reduced. RNAseq libraries were prepared from the globin-reduced RNA. Overall design: Subjects from the control arms of 6 clinical trials in new-onset T1D were aggregated to evaluate variation in disease course in the immediate post-diagnostic period. All trials used serum C-peptide concentration after a mixed-meal tolerance test as the primary outcome, with an initial trial duration of approximately two years, with longer-term follow-up in some cases. We obtained RNA-seq data from all available subject visits (N = 138 subjects), ranging from the time of study entry to three years, for a total of 496 samples (mean 3.6 samples per subject). Three samples were removed due to SNP-based kinship values indicating sample contamination or mis-identification; these samples are excluded from the submitted dataset. Of the remaining 493 samples, 471 yielded high-quality RNA-seq data from unique visits consistent with subject annotation, and were used in downstream analyses.",Multiple time points per subject

Overall design: Samples are collected from subjects in a household contact study after a person comes back to the household, diagnosed with TB. Samples are collected every 6 months upto, 18 months. Some people go on to develop TB (cases) where as some others do not (controls). Here we are trying to establish a gene signature to predict the occurance of TB.",
"Transcriptome profiling from adipose tissue during low-caloric diet reveals predictors of long-term weight and glycemic outcomes in obese, non-diabetic subjects",SRP101294,,control,"Background: Low-caloric diet (LCD) reduces fat mass excess, improves insulin sensitivity, and alters adipose tissue (AT) gene expression. Yet the relationship with long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. Objective: We evaluated transcriptome alterations in AT during LCD and association with weight and glycemic outcomes both at LCD termination and 6-month after the LCD. Results: Upon LCD, we identified 1'173 genes differentially expressed; with 350 and 33 genes associated respectively with changes in BMI and Matsuda. Twenty-nine genes were associated with both endpoints. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment in lipid and glucose metabolism. Models were constructed to predict weight maintainers. A model based on clinical baseline parameters could not achieve any prediction (validation's AUC= 0.50 [0.36, 0.64]), while a model based on clinical changes during LCD yielded to good performance (AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.87]). Incorporating baseline expression from the 18 genes outperformed the best clinical model (AUC=0.87 [0.77, 0.96], Delong's p=0.012). Similar analyses were made to predict subjects with good glycemic improvements. Both baseline- and LCD-based clinical models yielded to similar performance (with best AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.85]). Addition of expression changes during LCD improved substantially the performance (AUC=0.80 [0.69, 0.92], p=0.058). Conclusions: This study investigated AT transcriptome alterations following LCD in a large cohort of obese, non-diabetic patients. The identified genes enabled to significantly improve clinical models and predict long-term clinical outcomes. These biomarkers may help clinicians understanding the large inter-subject variability and better predict the success of dietary interventions. Overall design: Design: Using RNAseq, we analyzed transcriptome changes in AT from 191 obese, non-diabetic patients within a multi-center controlled dietary intervention. Expression changes were associated with outcomes after 8-week LCD (with 800-1000kcal/d) and 6-month after LCD. Results were validated using RT-qPCR in 350 subjects from the same cohort. Statistical models were constructed to predict subjects considered as weight maintainers or glycemic improvers 6-month after LCD.",Diet change

Analysis of parent-of-origin bias in gene expression levels,SRP095272,,control,"In order to study parent-of-origin effects on gene expression, we performed RNAseq analysis (100bp single end reads) of 165 children who formed part of mother/father/child trios where genotype data was available from the HapMap and/or 1000 Genomes Projects. Based on phased genotypes at heterozygous SNP positions, we generated allelic counts for expression of the maternal and paternal alleles in each individual. This analysis reveals significant bias in the expression of the parental alleles for dozens of genes, including both previously known and novel imprinted transcripts. Overall design: This submission contains RNAseq data from 165 children from mother/father/child trios studied as part of the 1000 genomes and/or HapMap projects. We provide raw fastq format reads, and processed read counts per gene. Allelic count information can be provided by directly contacting the authors.",They use 1000 genomes/hapmap individuals
Gene expression associated with PTSD in World Trade Center responders: An RNA sequencing study,SRP102999,,case-cotrol,"The gene expression approach has provided promising insights into the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, few studies used hypothesis-free transcriptome-wide expression approach. Transcriptome-wide expression study using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of whole blood was conducted in 324 World Trade Center responders (201 with never, 81 current and 42 past PTSD). The current and never PTSD samples were randomly split to form both discovery (N=195) and replication (N=87) cohorts. Differentially expressed genes identified in RNA-Seq were used in pathway analysis and to create a polygenic expression score. There were 448 differentially expressed genes in the discovery cohort, of which 99 remained significant in the replication cohort, and 5 (FKBP5, NDUFA1, CCDC85B, SNORD54, SNORD46) showed >1.2-fold difference in expression consistently between the discovery and replication cohorts. Several enriched biological pathways were found, including glucocorticoid receptor signaling and immunity-related pathways, but were not significant following FDR correction. The gene expression score achieved sensitivity of 0.917 and specificity of 0.508 for identifying PTSD cases in the replication cohort. It was similar in current and past PTSD, with both groups scoring higher than trauma-exposed controls. We confirmed the role of FKBP5 in PTSD and identified four additional differentially expressed genes that may constitute biomarkers for this condition. Together with the pathway analysis results, these findings point to HPA-axis and immune dysregulation as key biological processes underpinning PTSD. A novel polygenic expression aggregate that differentiates PTSD patients from trauma-exposed controls might be a useful screening tool for research and clinical practice, if replicated in other populations. Overall design: 324 human samples; 201 never, 82 current, 41 past with PTSD. Gene expression profiling by high throughput sequencing",

"RNA-seq of tumor-educated platelets enables blood-based pan-cancer, multiclass and molecular pathway cancer diagnostics",SRP057500,,multi-group,"	We report RNA-sequencing data of 283 blood platelet samples, including 228 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with six different malignant tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer and hepatobiliary carcinomas). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 55 healthy individuals. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based ''liquid biopsies'' in patients with several types with cancer, including the ability for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer and companion diagnostics. Overall design: Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the human reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq. The processed data includes 285 samples (columns) and 57736 ensemble gene ids (rows). The supplementary data file (TEP_data_matrix.txt) contains the intron-spanning read counts, after data summarization by HTseq.",

RNA-seq analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis,SRP069212,,case-control,"Portal vein tumor thrombosis is a strong poor indication of HCC. Characterizing the molecular alterations of these metastatic HCCs is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms during HCC progression and metastasis. Previous genomic studies mainly focus on single molecular layer, such as gene expressions or exonic mutations. In this study, we systematically examined the copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation, miRNA and transcriptome of matched adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors and PVTTs from 19 HCC patients. Based on the integrative multi-omics profiles, we established the molecular landscape of the metastatic HCCs and identified a set of the recurrent genomic alterations and candidate driver genes.

Elucidating the etiology and molecular pathogenicity of infectious diarrhea by high throughput RNA sequencing,SRP059039,,multi-group,"Diarrhea remains a major cause of death in children. Current diagnostic methods largely rely on stool culture and suffer from low sensitivity and inadequate specificity, often leading to inappropriate treatment. The objective of the present study was to use RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis to determine blood transcriptional profiles specific for several common pathogenic bacteria and viruses that cause diarrhea in children. We collected whole blood samples from children in Mexico having diarrhea associated with a single pathogen and without systemic complications. Our RNAseq data suggested that the blood signatures can differentiate children with diarrhea from healthy children either with or without bacterial colonization. Moreover, we detected different expression profiles from bacterial and viral infection, demonstrating for the first time the use of RNAseq to identify the etiology of infectious diarrhea. Overall design: 255 whole blood samples from 246 children including children with diarrhea caused by rotavirus (n=60 total; 5 repeated; 55 unique), E.coli (n=55), Salmonella (n=36), Shigella (n=37), adenovirus (n=8), norovirus (n=7), and control children (n=52 total; 4 repeated; 48 unique).",
Natural selection has contributed to functional immune response differences between human hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists,SRP162654,,multi-group,"The shift from a hunter-gatherer (HG) to an agricultural (AG) mode of subsistence is believed to have been associated with profound changes in the burden and diversity of pathogens across human populations. Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture impacted the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to bacterial and viral stimuli between the Batwa, a rainforest hunter-gatherer, and the Bakiga, an agriculturalist population from Central Africa. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the transcriptional response to viruses compared to that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control, and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Unexpectedly, we found stronger signatures of recent natural selection in the rainforest hunter-gatherers, which argues against the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations. Overall design: Gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were simulated with the viral ligand Gardiquimod (GARD), the bacterial ligand lippopolysacharide (LPS), or a match un-stimulated control (CTL)",CTL = control
Molecular Hallmarks of Naturally Acquired Immunity to Malaria,SRP032775,,paired-exposure,"Immunity to malaria can be acquired through natural exposure to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), but only after years of repeated infections. Typically, this immunity is acquired by adolescence and confers protection against disease, but not Pf infection per se. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of this immunity are integral to the development of a vaccine that would mimic the induction of adult immunity in children. The current study applies transcriptomic analyses to a cohort from the rural village of Kalifabougou, Mali, where Pf transmission is intense and seasonal. Signatures that correlate with protection from malaria may yield new hypotheses regarding the biological mechanisms through which malaria immunity is induced by natural Pf infection. The resulting datasets will be of considerable value in the urgent worldwide effort to develop a malaria vaccine that could prevent more than a million deaths annually. Overall design: 108 samples; paired pre- and post-challenge for 54 individuals 198 samples; paired pre- and post-challenge for 99 individuals",
Cell type specific gene expression patterns associated with posttraumatic stress disorder in World Trade Center responders,SRP145493,,paired-exposure,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to immunologic dysregulation. Gene expression profiling has emerged as a promising tool for understanding the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, to date, all but one gene expression study was based on whole blood or unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), a complex tissue consisting of several populations of cells. The objective of this study was to utilize RNA sequencing to simultaneously profile the gene-expression of four immune cell subpopulations in World Trade Center responders. Pathway analyses identified gene sets related to immune response and inflammation as being among the differentially expressed genes in PTSD, including mast cell activation and regulation in CD4T, interferon-beta production in CD8T, and neutrophil related gene sets in monocytes. These findings are suggestive that immune cell dysregulation involves gene expression in various cell populations.",Possibly repeat of SRP102999 
Gene Networks Specific for Innate Immunity Define Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [RNA-Seq],SRP051848,,?,"The molecular factors involved in the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remain poorly understood. Previous transcriptomic studies investigating the mechanisms of PTSD apply targeted approaches to identify individual genes under a cross-sectional framework lack a holistic view of the behaviours and properties of these genes at the system-level. Here we sought to apply an unsupervised gene-network based approach to a prospective experimental design using whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq gene expression from peripheral blood leukocytes of U.S. Marines (N=188), obtained both pre- and post-deployment to conflict zones. We identified discrete groups of co-regulated genes (i.e., co-expression modules) and tested them for association to PTSD. We identified one module at both pre- and post-deployment containing putative causal signatures for PTSD development displaying an over-expression of genes enriched for functions of innate-immune response and interferon signalling (Type-I and Type-II). Importantly, these results were replicated in a second non-overlapping independent dataset of U.S. Marines (N=96), further outlining the role of innate immune and interferon signalling genes within co-expression modules to explain at least part of the causal pathophysiology for PTSD development. A second module, consequential of trauma exposure, contained PTSD resiliency signatures and an over-expression of genes involved in hemostasis and wound responsiveness suggesting that chronic levels of stress impair proper wound healing during/after exposure to the battlefield while highlighting the role of the hemostatic system as a clinical indicator of chronic-based stress. These findings provide novel insights for early preventative measures and advanced PTSD detection, which may lead to interventions that delay or perhaps abrogate the development of PTSD. We used RNA-Sequencing gene expression to characterize both prognostic and diagnostic molecular signatures associated to PTSD risk and PTSD status compared to control subjects. Overall design: Peripheral blood luekocytes gene expression was subject to transcriptional analysis for 94 service members both prior-to and following-deployment to conflict zones. Half of the subjects returned with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while the other half did not.",
Transcriptome analysis of psoriasis in a large case-control sample: RNA-seq provides insights into disease mechanisms,SRP035988,,case-control,"To increase our understanding of psoriasis, we utilized RNA-seq to assay the transcriptomes of lesional psoriatic and normal skin. We sequenced polyadenylated RNA-derived cDNAs from 92 psoriatic and 82 normal punch biopsies, generating an average of ~38 million single-end 80-bp reads per sample. Comparison of 42 samples* examined by both RNA-seq and microarray [GSE13355] revealed marked differences in sensitivity, with transcripts identified only by RNA-seq having much lower expression than those also identified by microarray. RNA-seq identified many more differentially expressed transcripts enriched in immune system processes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed multiple modules of coordinately expressed epidermal differentiation genes, overlapping significantly with genes regulated by the long non-coding RNA TINCR, its target gene, staufen-1 (STAU1), the p63 target gene ZNF750, and its target KLF4. Other coordinately expressed modules were enriched for lymphoid and/or myeloid signature transcripts and genes induced by IL-17 in keratinocytes. Dermally-expressed genes were significantly down-regulated in psoriatic biopsies, most likely due to expansion of the epidermal compartment. These results demonstrate the power of WGCNA to elucidate gene regulatory circuits in psoriasis, and emphasize the influence of tissue architecture in both differential expression and co-expression analysis. *The list of 42 samples examined by both RNA-seq and microarray is provided in the ''MAoverlappedsamples.txt''. Overall design: 92 psoriatic and 82 normal skin samples",
